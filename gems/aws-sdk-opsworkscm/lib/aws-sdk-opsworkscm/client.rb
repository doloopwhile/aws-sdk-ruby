    # @option options [required, Aws::CredentialProvider] :credentials
    #   Your AWS credentials. This can be an instance of any one of the
    #   following classes:
    #
    #   * `Aws::Credentials` - Used for configuring static, non-refreshing
    #     credentials.
    #
    #   * `Aws::InstanceProfileCredentials` - Used for loading credentials
    #     from an EC2 IMDS on an EC2 instance.
    #
    #   * `Aws::SharedCredentials` - Used for loading credentials from a
    #     shared file, such as `~/.aws/config`.
    #
    #   * `Aws::AssumeRoleCredentials` - Used when you need to assume a role.
    #
    #   When `:credentials` are not configured directly, the following
    #   locations will be searched for credentials:
    #
    #   * `Aws.config[:credentials]`
    #   * The `:access_key_id`, `:secret_access_key`, and `:session_token` options.
    #   * ENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'], ENV['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY']
    #   * `~/.aws/credentials`
    #   * `~/.aws/config`
    #   * EC2 IMDS instance profile - When used by default, the timeouts are
    #     very aggressive. Construct and pass an instance of
    #     `Aws::InstanceProfileCredentails` to enable retries and extended
    #     timeouts.
    #
    # @option options [required, String] :region
    #   The AWS region to connect to.  The configured `:region` is
    #   used to determine the service `:endpoint`. When not passed,
    #   a default `:region` is search for in the following locations:
    #
    #   * `Aws.config[:region]`
    #   * `ENV['AWS_REGION']`
    #   * `ENV['AMAZON_REGION']`
    #   * `ENV['AWS_DEFAULT_REGION']`
    #   * `~/.aws/credentials`
    #   * `~/.aws/config`
    #
    # @option options [String] :access_key_id
    #
    # @option options [Boolean] :convert_params (true)
    #   When `true`, an attempt is made to coerce request parameters into
    #   the required types.
    #
    # @option options [String] :endpoint
    #   The client endpoint is normally constructed from the `:region`
    #   option. You should only configure an `:endpoint` when connecting
    #   to test endpoints. This should be avalid HTTP(S) URI.
    #
    # @option options [Aws::Log::Formatter] :log_formatter (Aws::Log::Formatter.default)
    #   The log formatter.
    #
    # @option options [Symbol] :log_level (:info)
    #   The log level to send messages to the `:logger` at.
    #
    # @option options [Logger] :logger
    #   The Logger instance to send log messages to.  If this option
    #   is not set, logging will be disabled.
    #
    # @option options [String] :profile ("default")
    #   Used when loading credentials from the shared credentials file
    #   at HOME/.aws/credentials.  When not specified, 'default' is used.
    #
    # @option options [Integer] :retry_limit (3)
    #   The maximum number of times to retry failed requests.  Only
    #   ~ 500 level server errors and certain ~ 400 level client errors
    #   are retried.  Generally, these are throttling errors, data
    #   checksum errors, networking errors, timeout errors and auth
    #   errors from expired credentials.
    #
    # @option options [String] :secret_access_key
    #
    # @option options [String] :session_token
    #
    # @option options [Boolean] :simple_json (false)
    #   Disables request parameter conversion, validation, and formatting.
    #   Also disable response data type conversions. This option is useful
    #   when you want to ensure the highest level of performance by
    #   avoiding overhead of walking request parameters and response data
    #   structures.
    #
    #   When `:simple_json` is enabled, the request parameters hash must
    #   be formatted exactly as the DynamoDB API expects.
    #
    # @option options [Boolean] :stub_responses (false)
    #   Causes the client to return stubbed responses. By default
    #   fake responses are generated and returned. You can specify
    #   the response data to return or errors to raise by calling
    #   {ClientStubs#stub_responses}. See {ClientStubs} for more information.
    #
    #   ** Please note ** When response stubbing is enabled, no HTTP
    #   requests are made, and retries are disabled.
    #
    # @option options [Boolean] :validate_params (true)
    #   When `true`, request parameters are validated before
    #   sending the request.

    #
    # @option params [String] :preferred_maintenance_window
    #   The start time for a one-hour period each week during which AWS
    #   OpsWorks for Chef Automate performs maintenance on the instance. Valid
    #   values must be specified in the following format: `DDD:HH:MM`. The
    #   specified time is in coordinated universal time (UTC). The default
    #   value is a random one-hour period on Tuesday, Wednesday, or Friday.
    #   See `TimeWindowDefinition` for more information.
    #
    #   **Example:** `Mon:08:00`, which represents a start time of every
    #   Monday at 08:00 UTC. (8:00 a.m.)
    #
    # @option params [String] :preferred_backup_window
    #   The start time for a one-hour period during which AWS OpsWorks for
    #   Chef Automate backs up application-level data on your server if
    #   automated backups are enabled. Valid values must be specified in one
    #   of the following formats:
    #
    #   * `HH:MM` for daily backups
    #
    #   * `DDD:HH:MM` for weekly backups
    #
    #   The specified time is in coordinated universal time (UTC). The default
    #   value is a random, daily start time.
    #
    #   **Example:** `08:00`, which represents a daily start time of 08:00
    #   UTC.
    #
    #   **Example:** `Mon:08:00`, which represents a start time of every
    #   Monday at 08:00 UTC. (8:00 a.m.)
    #
    # @option params [Array<String>] :security_group_ids
    #   A list of security group IDs to attach to the Amazon EC2 instance. If
    #   you add this parameter, the specified security groups must be within
    #   the VPC that is specified by `SubnetIds`.
    #
    #   If you do not specify this parameter, AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate
    #   creates one new security group that uses TCP ports 22 and 443, open to
    #   0.0.0.0/0 (everyone).
    #
    # @option params [required, String] :service_role_arn
    #   The service role that the AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate service
    #   backend uses to work with your account. Although the AWS OpsWorks
    #   management console typically creates the service role for you, if you
    #   are using the AWS CLI or API commands, run the
    #   service-role-creation.yaml AWS CloudFormation template, located at
    #   https://s3.amazonaws.com/opsworks-stuff/latest/service-role-creation.yaml.
    #   This template creates a CloudFormation stack that includes the service
    #   role that you need.
    #
    # @option params [Array<String>] :subnet_ids
    #   The IDs of subnets in which to launch the server EC2 instance.
    #
    #   Amazon EC2-Classic customers: This field is required. All servers must
    #   run within a VPC. The VPC must have "Auto Assign Public IP" enabled.
    #
    #   EC2-VPC customers: This field is optional. If you do not specify
    #   subnet IDs, your EC2 instances are created in a default subnet that is
    #   selected by Amazon EC2. If you specify subnet IDs, the VPC must have
    #   "Auto Assign Public IP" enabled.
    #
